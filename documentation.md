Specification
-------------

The latest Internet-Drafts at the IETF are the draft-wright-json-schema\*-01 documents, which correspond to the draft-06 meta-schemas. These were published on 2017-04-15. (Due to a change in authorship the I-D numbering was reset with the previous draft). The specification is split into three parts, Core, Validation, and Hyper-Schema:

|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [JSON Schema Core](latest/json-schema-core.html)             | defines the basic foundation of JSON Schema     |
| [JSON Schema Validation](latest/json-schema-validation.html) | defines the validation keywords of JSON Schema  |
| [JSON Hyper-Schema](latest/json-schema-hypermedia.html)      | defines the hyper-media keywords of JSON Schema |

They are also available on the IETF main site: [core (draft-wright-json-schema-01)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wright-json-schema-01), [validation (draft-wright-json-schema-validation-01)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wright-json-schema-validation-01) and [hyper-schema (draft-wright-json-schema-hyperschema-01)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wright-json-schema-hyperschema-01).

For previous versions of the specification, please see the [Specification Links](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/wiki/Specification-Links) page on our github wiki.

Meta-schemas
------------

The meta-schemas are the schemas which define the JSON Schema and Hyper-Schema formats.

The latest meta-schema is draft-06.

|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Core/Validation Meta-Schema](http://json-schema.org/schema) | Used for schemas written for pure validation.              |
| [Hyper Meta-Schema](http://json-schema.org/hyper-schema)     | Used for schemas written for validation and hyper-linking. |
