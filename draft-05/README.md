## Explanation for lack of draft-05 meta-schemas

"Draft-05" in the sequential meta-schema numbering would have
referred to the draft-wright-jsonschema\*-00 specifications.

These specifications were intended as modernized and tidied
versions of the specifications referenced by the "Draft-04"
meta-schemas, so those draft-04 meta-schemas should continue
to be used.

"Draft-06" meta-schemas will be published for the next set of
specifications.
