 JSON Schema Validation: A Vocabulary for Structural Validation of JSON
                draft-handrews-json-schema-validation-WIP

Abstract

   JSON Schema (application/schema+json) has several purposes, one of
   which is JSON instance validation.  This document specifies a
   vocabulary for JSON Schema to describe the meaning of JSON documents,
   provide hints for user interfaces working with JSON data, and to make
   assertions about what a valid document must look like.

1.  Introduction

   JSON Schema can be used to require that a given JSON document (an
   instance) satisfies a certain number of criteria.  These criteria are
   asserted by using keywords described in this specification.  In
   addition, a set of keywords is also defined to assist in interactive
   user interface instance generation.

   This specification will use the concepts, syntax, and terminology
   defined by the JSON Schema core [json-schema] specification.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This specification uses the term "container instance" to refer to
   both array and object instances.  It uses the term "children
   instances" to refer to array elements or object member values.

   Elements in an array value are said to be unique if no two elements
   of this array are equal [json-schema].

3.  Overview

   JSON Schema validation asserts constraints on the structure of
   instance data.  An instance location that satisfies all asserted
   constraints is then annotated with any keywords that contain non-
   assertion information, such as descriptive metadata and usage hints.
   If all locations within the instance satisfy all asserted
   constraints, then the instance is said to be valid against the
   schema.

   Each schema object is independently evaluated against each instance
   location to which it applies.  This greatly simplifies the
   implementation requirements for validators by ensuring that they do
   not need to maintain state across the document-wide validation
   process.

   This specification defines a set of assertion keywords, as well as a
   small vocabulary of metadata keywords that can be used to annotate
   the JSON instance with useful information.  The Section 7 and
   Section 8 keywords are also useful as annotations as well as being
   optional assertions, as they convey additional usage guidance for the
   instance data.

4.  Interoperability Considerations

4.1.  Validation of String Instances

   It should be noted that the nul character (\u0000) is valid in a JSON
   string.  An instance to validate may contain a string value with this
   character, regardless of the ability of the underlying programming
   language to deal with such data.

Internet-Draft           JSON Schema Validation              August 2019


4.2.  Validation of Numeric Instances

   The JSON specification allows numbers with arbitrary precision, and
   JSON Schema does not add any such bounds.  This means that numeric
   instances processed by JSON Schema can be arbitrarily large and/or
   have an arbitrarily long decimal part, regardless of the ability of
   the underlying programming language to deal with such data.

4.3.  Regular Expressions

   Keywords that use regular expressions, or constrain the instance
   value to be a regular expression, are subject to the interoperability
   considerations for regular expressions in the JSON Schema Core
   [json-schema] specification.

5.  Meta-Schema

   The current URI for the JSON Schema Validation meta-schema is
   <http://json-schema.org/draft/2019-WIP/schema#>.  For schema author
   convenience, this meta-schema describes all vocabularies defined in
   this specification and the JSON Schema Core specification.
   Individual vocabulary and vocabulary meta-schema URIs are given for
   each section below.  Certain vocabularies are optional to support,
   which is explained in detail in the relevant sections.

   Updated vocabulary and meta-schema URIs MAY be published between
   specification drafts in order to correct errors.  Implementations
   SHOULD consider URIs dated after this specification draft and before
   the next to indicate the same syntax and semantics as those listed
   here.

6.  A Vocabulary for Structural Validation

   Validation keywords in a schema impose requirements for successful
   validation of an instance.  These keywords are all assertions without
   any annotation behavior.

   Meta-schemas that do not use "$vocabulary" SHOULD be considered to
   require this vocabulary as if its URI were present with a value of
   true.

   The current URI for this vocabulary, known as the Validation
   vocabulary, is: <https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-WIP/vocab/
   validation>.

   The current URI for the corresponding meta-schema is: <https://json-
   schema.org/draft/2019-WIP/meta/validation>.

6.1.  Validation Keywords for Any Instance Type

6.1.1.  type

   The value of this keyword MUST be either a string or an array.  If it
   is an array, elements of the array MUST be strings and MUST be
   unique.

   String values MUST be one of the six primitive types ("null",
   "boolean", "object", "array", "number", or "string"), or "integer"
   which matches any number with a zero fractional part.

   An instance validates if and only if the instance is in any of the
   sets listed for this keyword.

6.1.2.  enum

   The value of this keyword MUST be an array.  This array SHOULD have
   at least one element.  Elements in the array SHOULD be unique.

   An instance validates successfully against this keyword if its value
   is equal to one of the elements in this keyword's array value.

   Elements in the array might be of any type, including null.

6.1.3.  const

   The value of this keyword MAY be of any type, including null.

   Use of this keyword is functionally equivalent to an "enum"
   (Section 6.1.2) with a single value.

   An instance validates successfully against this keyword if its value
   is equal to the value of the keyword.

6.2.  Validation Keywords for Numeric Instances (number and integer)

6.2.1.  multipleOf

   The value of "multipleOf" MUST be a number, strictly greater than 0.

   A numeric instance is valid only if division by this keyword's value
   results in an integer.

Internet-Draft           JSON Schema Validation              August 2019


6.2.2.  maximum

   The value of "maximum" MUST be a number, representing an inclusive
   upper limit for a numeric instance.

   If the instance is a number, then this keyword validates only if the
   instance is less than or exactly equal to "maximum".

6.2.3.  exclusiveMaximum

   The value of "exclusiveMaximum" MUST be number, representing an
   exclusive upper limit for a numeric instance.

   If the instance is a number, then the instance is valid only if it
   has a value strictly less than (not equal to) "exclusiveMaximum".

6.2.4.  minimum

   The value of "minimum" MUST be a number, representing an inclusive
   lower limit for a numeric instance.

   If the instance is a number, then this keyword validates only if the
   instance is greater than or exactly equal to "minimum".

6.2.5.  exclusiveMinimum

   The value of "exclusiveMinimum" MUST be number, representing an
   exclusive lower limit for a numeric instance.

   If the instance is a number, then the instance is valid only if it
   has a value strictly greater than (not equal to) "exclusiveMinimum".

6.3.  Validation Keywords for Strings

6.3.1.  maxLength

   The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

   A string instance is valid against this keyword if its length is less
   than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.

   The length of a string instance is defined as the number of its
   characters as defined by RFC 8259 [RFC8259].

Internet-Draft           JSON Schema Validation              August 2019


6.3.2.  minLength

   The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

   A string instance is valid against this keyword if its length is
   greater than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.

   The length of a string instance is defined as the number of its
   characters as defined by RFC 8259 [RFC8259].

   Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of 0.

6.3.3.  pattern

   The value of this keyword MUST be a string.  This string SHOULD be a
   valid regular expression, according to the ECMA 262 regular
   expression dialect.

   A string instance is considered valid if the regular expression
   matches the instance successfully.  Recall: regular expressions are
   not implicitly anchored.

6.4.  Validation Keywords for Arrays

6.4.1.  maxItems

   The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

   An array instance is valid against "maxItems" if its size is less
   than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.

6.4.2.  minItems

   The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

   An array instance is valid against "minItems" if its size is greater
   than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.

   Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of 0.

6.4.3.  uniqueItems

   The value of this keyword MUST be a boolean.

   If this keyword has boolean value false, the instance validates
   successfully.  If it has boolean value true, the instance validates
   successfully if all of its elements are unique.

Internet-Draft           JSON Schema Validation              August 2019


   Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of false.

6.4.4.  maxContains

   The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

   An array instance is valid against "maxContains" if the number of
   elements that are valid against the schema for "contains"
   [json-schema] is less than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.

   If "contains" is not present within the same schema object, then this
   keyword has no effect.

6.4.5.  minContains

   The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

   An array instance is valid against "minContains" if the number of
   elements that are valid against the schema for "contains"
   [json-schema] is greater than, or equal to, the value of this
   keyword.

   A value of 0 is allowed, but is only useful for setting a range of
   occurrences from 0 to the value of "maxContains".  A value of 0 with
   no "maxContains" causes "contains" to always pass validation.

   If "contains" is not present within the same schema object, then this
   keyword has no effect.

   Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of 1.

6.5.  Validation Keywords for Objects

6.5.1.  maxProperties

   The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

   An object instance is valid against "maxProperties" if its number of
   properties is less than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.

6.5.2.  minProperties

   The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

   An object instance is valid against "minProperties" if its number of
   properties is greater than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.

   Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of 0.

6.5.3.  required

   The value of this keyword MUST be an array.  Elements of this array,
   if any, MUST be strings, and MUST be unique.

   An object instance is valid against this keyword if every item in the
   array is the name of a property in the instance.

   Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as an empty array.

6.5.4.  dependentRequired

   The value of this keyword MUST be an object.  Properties in this
   object, if any, MUST be arrays.  Elements in each array, if any, MUST
   be strings, and MUST be unique.

   This keyword specifies properties that are required if a specific
   other property is present.  Their requirement is dependent on the
   presence of the other property.

   Validation succeeds if, for each name that appears in both the
   instance and as a name within this keyword's value, every item in the
   corresponding array is also the name of a property in the instance.

   Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as an empty object.

7.  A Vocabulary for Semantic Content With "format"

7.1.  Foreword

   Structural validation alone may be insufficient to allow an
   application to correctly utilize certain values.  The "format"
   annotation keyword is defined to allow schema authors to convey
   semantic information for a fixed subset of values which are
   accurately described by authoritative resources, be they RFCs or
   other external specifications.

   Implementations MAY treat "format" as an assertion in addition to an
   annotation, and attempt to validate the value's conformance to the
   specified semantics.  See the Implementation Requirements below for
   details.

   The value of this keyword is called a format attribute.  It MUST be a
   string.  A format attribute can generally only validate a given set
   of instance types.  If the type of the instance to validate is not in
   this set, validation for this format attribute and instance SHOULD
   succeed.  All format attributes defined in this section apply to
   strings, but a format attribute can be specified to apply to any

   instance types defined in the data model defined in the core JSON
   Schema. [json-schema] [[CREF1: Note that the "type" keyword in this
   specification defines an "integer" type which is not part of the data
   model.  Therefore a format attribute can be limited to numbers, but
   not specifically to integers.  However, a numeric format can be used
   alongside the "type" keyword with a value of "integer", or could be
   explicitly defined to always pass if the number is not an integer,
   which produces essentially the same behavior as only applying to
   integers.  ]]

   Meta-schemas that do not use "$vocabulary" SHOULD be considered to
   utilize this vocabulary as if its URI were present with a value of
   false.  See the Implementation Requirements below for details.

   The current URI for this vocabulary, known as the Format vocabulary,
   is: <https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-WIP/vocab/format>.

   The current URI for the corresponding meta-schema is: <https://json-
   schema.org/draft/2019-WIP/meta/format>.

7.2.  Implementation Requirements

   The "format" keyword functions as an annotation, and optionally as an
   assertion.  [[CREF2: This is due to the keyword's history, and is not
   in line with current keyword design principles.]] In order to manage
   this ambiguity, the "format" keyword is defined in its own separate
   vocabulary, as noted above.  The true or false value of the
   vocabulary declaration governs the implementation requirements
   necessary to process a schema that uses "format", and the behaviors
   on which schema authors can rely.

7.2.1.  As an annotation

   The value of format MUST be collected as an annotation, if the
   implementation supports annotation collection.  This enables
   application-level validation when schema validation is unavailable or
   inadequate.

   This requirement is not affected by the boolean value of the
   vocabulary declaration, nor by the configuration of "format"'s
   assertion behavior described in the next section.  [[CREF3: Requiring
   annotation collection even when the vocabulary is declared with a
   value of false is atypical, but necessary to ensure that the best
   practice of performing application-level validation is possible even
   when assertion evaluation is not implemented.  Since "format" has
   always been a part of this specification, requiring implementations
   to be aware of it even with a false vocabulary declaration is deemed
   to not be a burden.  ]]

7.2.2.  As an assertion

   Regardless of the boolean value of the vocabulary declaration, an
   implementation that can evaluate "format" as an assertion MUST
   provide options to enable and disable such evaluation.  The assertion
   evaluation behavior when the option is not explicitly specified
   depends on the vocabulary declaration's boolean value.

   When implementing this entire specification, this vocabulary MUST be
   supported with a value of false (but see details below), and MAY be
   supported with a value of true.

   When the vocabulary is declared with a value of false, an
   implementation:

      MUST NOT evaluate "format" as an assertion unless it is explicitly
      configured to do so;

      SHOULD provide an implementation-specific best effort validation
      for each format attribute defined below;

      MAY choose to implement validation of any or all format attributes
      as a no-op by always producing a validation result of true;

      SHOULD document its level of support for validation.

   [[CREF4: This matches the current reality of implementations, which
   provide widely varying levels of validation, including no validation
   at all, for some or all format attributes.  It is also designed to
   encourage relying only on the annotation behavior and performing
   semantic validation in the application, which is the recommended best
   practice.  ]]

   When the vocabulary is declared with a value of true, an
   implementation that supports this form of the vocabulary:

      MUST evaluate "format" as an assertion unless it is explicitly
      configured not to do so;

      MUST implement syntactic validation for all format attributes
      defined in this specification, and for any additional format
      attributes that it recognizes, such that there exist possible
      instance values of the correct type that will fail validation.

   The requirement for minimal validation of format attributes is
   intentionally vague and permissive, due to the complexity involved in
   many of the attributes.  Note in particular that the requirement is
   limited to syntactic checking; it is not to be expected that an



Wright, et al.          Expires February 11, 2020              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           JSON Schema Validation              August 2019


   implementation would send an email, attempt to connect to a URL, or
   otherwise check the existence of an entity identified by a format
   instance.  [[CREF5: The expectation is that for simple formats such
   as date-time, syntactic validation will be thorough.  For a complex
   format such as email addresses, which are the amalgamation of various
   standards and numerous adjustments over time, with obscure and/or
   obsolete rules that may or may not be restricted by other
   applications making use of the value, a minimal validation is
   sufficient.  For example, an instance string that does not contain an
   "@" is clearly not a valid email address, and an "email" or
   "hostname" containing characters outside of 7-bit ASCII is likewise
   clearly invalid.  ]]

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations use a common parsing library
   for each format, or a well-known regular expression.  Implementations
   SHOULD clearly document how and to what degree each format attribute
   is validated.

   The standard core and validation meta-schema (Section 5) includes
   this vocabulary in its "$vocabulary" keyword with a value of false,
   since by default implementations are not required to support this
   keyword as an assertion.  Supporting the format vocabulary with a
   value of true is understood to greatly increase code size and in some
   cases execution time, and will not be appropriate for all
   implementations.

7.2.3.  Custom format attributes

   Implementations MAY support custom format attributes.  Save for
   agreement between parties, schema authors SHALL NOT expect a peer
   implementation to support such custom format attributes.  An
   implementation MUST NOT fail validation or cease processing due to an
   unknown format attribute.  When treating "format" as an annotation,
   implementations SHOULD collect both known and unknown format
   attribute values.

   Vocabularies do not support specifically declaring different value
   sets for keywords.  Due to this limitation, and the historically
   uneven implementation of this keyword, it is RECOMMENDED to define
   additional keywords in a custom vocabulary rather than additional
   format attributes if interoperability is desired.

7.3.  Defined Formats

Internet-Draft           JSON Schema Validation              August 2019


7.3.1.  Dates, Times, and Duration

   These attributes apply to string instances.

   Date and time format names are derived from RFC 3339, section 5.6
   [RFC3339].  The duration format is from the ISO 8601 ABNF as given in
   Appendix A of RFC 3339.

   Implementations supporting formats SHOULD implement support for the
   following attributes:

   date-time:  A string instance is valid against this attribute if it
      is a valid representation according to the "date-time" production.

   date:  A string instance is valid against this attribute if it is a
      valid representation according to the "full-date" production.

   time:  A string instance is valid against this attribute if it is a
      valid representation according to the "full-time" production.

   duration:  A string instance is valid against this attribute if it is
      a valid representation according to the "duration" production.

   Implementations MAY support additional attributes using the other
   production names defined in that section.  If "full-date" or "full-
   time" are implemented, the corresponding short form ("date" or "time"
   respectively) MUST be implemented, and MUST behave identically.
   Implementations SHOULD NOT define extension attributes with any name
   matching an RFC 3339 production unless it validates according to the
   rules of that production.  [[CREF6: There is not currently consensus
   on the need for supporting all RFC 3339 formats, so this approach of
   reserving the namespace will encourage experimentation without
   committing to the entire set.  Either the format implementation
   requirements will become more flexible in general, or these will
   likely either be promoted to fully specified attributes or dropped.
   ]]

7.3.2.  Email Addresses

   These attributes apply to string instances.

   A string instance is valid against these attributes if it is a valid
   Internet email address as follows:

   email:  As defined by RFC 5322, section 3.4.1 [RFC5322].

   idn-email:  As defined by RFC 6531 [RFC6531]

Internet-Draft           JSON Schema Validation              August 2019


   Note that all strings valid against the "email" attribute are also
   valid against the "idn-email" attribute.

7.3.3.  Hostnames

   These attributes apply to string instances.

   A string instance is valid against these attributes if it is a valid
   representation for an Internet hostname as follows:

   hostname:  As defined by RFC 1123, section 2.1 [RFC1123], including
      host names produced using the Punycode algorithm specified in RFC
      5891, section 4.4 [RFC5891].

   idn-hostname:  As defined by either RFC 1123 as for hostname, or an
      internationalized hostname as defined by RFC 5890, section 2.3.2.3
      [RFC5890].

   Note that all strings valid against the "hostname" attribute are also
   valid against the "idn-hostname" attribute.

7.3.4.  IP Addresses

   These attributes apply to string instances.

   A string instance is valid against these attributes if it is a valid
   representation of an IP address as follows:

   ipv4:  An IPv4 address according to the "dotted-quad" ABNF syntax as
      defined in RFC 2673, section 3.2 [RFC2673].

   ipv6:  An IPv6 address as defined in RFC 4291, section 2.2 [RFC4291].

7.3.5.  Resource Identifiers

   These attributes apply to string instances.

   uri:  A string instance is valid against this attribute if it is a
      valid URI, according to [RFC3986].

   uri-reference:  A string instance is valid against this attribute if
      it is a valid URI Reference (either a URI or a relative-
      reference), according to [RFC3986].

   iri:  A string instance is valid against this attribute if it is a
      valid IRI, according to [RFC3987].

Internet-Draft           JSON Schema Validation              August 2019


   iri-reference:  A string instance is valid against this attribute if
      it is a valid IRI Reference (either an IRI or a relative-
      reference), according to [RFC3987].

   uuid:  A string instance is valid against this attribute if it is a
      valid string representation of a UUID, according to [RFC4122].

   Note that all valid URIs are valid IRIs, and all valid URI References
   are also valid IRI References.

   Note also that the "uuid" format is for plain UUIDs, not UUIDs in
   URNs.  An example is "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6".  For
   UUIDs as URNs, use the "uri" format, with a "pattern" regular
   expression of "^urn:uuid:" to indicate the URI scheme and URN
   namespace.

7.3.6.  uri-template

   This attribute applies to string instances.

   A string instance is valid against this attribute if it is a valid
   URI Template (of any level), according to [RFC6570].

   Note that URI Templates may be used for IRIs; there is no separate
   IRI Template specification.

7.3.7.  JSON Pointers

   These attributes apply to string instances.

   json-pointer:  A string instance is valid against this attribute if
      it is a valid JSON string representation of a JSON Pointer,
      according to RFC 6901, section 5 [RFC6901].

   relative-json-pointer:  A string instance is valid against this
      attribute if it is a valid Relative JSON Pointer
      [relative-json-pointer].

   To allow for both absolute and relative JSON Pointers, use "anyOf" or
   "oneOf" to indicate support for either format.

7.3.8.  regex

   This attribute applies to string instances.

   A regular expression, which SHOULD be valid according to the ECMA 262
   [ecma262] regular expression dialect.

   Implementations that validate formats MUST accept at least the subset
   of ECMA 262 defined in the Regular Expressions (Section 4.3) section
   of this specification, and SHOULD accept all valid ECMA 262
   expressions.

8.  A Vocabulary for the Contents of String-Encoded Data

8.1.  Foreword

   Annotations defined in this section indicate that an instance
   contains non-JSON data encoded in a JSON string.

   These properties provide additional information required to interpret
   JSON data as rich multimedia documents.  They describe the type of
   content, how it is encoded, and/or how it may be validated.  They do
   not function as validation assertions; a malformed string-encoded
   document MUST NOT cause the containing instance to be considered
   invalid.

   Meta-schemas that do not use "$vocabulary" SHOULD be considered to
   require this vocabulary as if its URI were present with a value of
   true.

   The current URI for this vocabulary, known as the Content vocabulary,
   is: <https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-WIP/vocab/content>.

   The current URI for the corresponding meta-schema is: <https://json-
   schema.org/draft/2019-WIP/meta/content>.

8.2.  Implementation Requirements

   Due to security and performance concerns, as well as the open-ended
   nature of possible content types, implementations MUST NOT
   automatically decode, parse, and/or validate the string contents by
   default.  This additionally supports the use case of embedded
   documents intended for processing by a different consumer than that
   which processed the containing document.

   All keywords in this section apply only to strings, and have no
   effect on other data types.

   Implementations MAY offer the ability to decode, parse, and/or
   validate the string contents automatically.  However, it MUST NOT
   perform these operations by default, and MUST provide the validation
   result of each string-encoded document separately from the enclosing
   document.  This process SHOULD be equivalent to fully evaluating the
   instance against the original schema, followed by using the
   annotations to decode, parse, and/or validate each string-encoded

   document.  [[CREF7: For now, the exact mechanism of performing and
   returning parsed data and/or validation results from such an
   automatic decoding, parsing, and validating feature is left
   unspecified.  Should such a feature prove popular, it may be
   specified more thoroughly in a future draft.  ]]

   See also the Security Considerations (Section 10) sections for
   possible vulnerabilities introduced by automatically processing the
   instance string according to these keywords.

8.3.  contentEncoding

   If the instance value is a string, this property defines that the
   string SHOULD be interpreted as binary data and decoded using the
   encoding named by this property.

   Possible values for this property are listed in RFC 2045, Sec 6.1
   [RFC2045] and RFC 4648 [RFC4648].  For "base64", which is defined in
   both RFCs, the definition in RFC 4648, which removes line length
   limitations, SHOULD be used, as various other specifications have
   mandated different lengths.  Note that line lengths within a string
   can be constrained using the "pattern" (Section 6.3.3) keyword.

   If this keyword is absent, but "contentMediaType" is present, this
   indicates that the media type could be encoded into UTF-8 like any
   other JSON string value, and does not require additional decoding.

   The value of this property MUST be a string.

8.4.  contentMediaType

   If the instance is a string, this property indicates the media type
   of the contents of the string.  If "contentEncoding" is present, this
   property describes the decoded string.

   The value of this property MUST be a string, which MUST be a media
   type, as defined by RFC 2046 [RFC2046].

8.5.  contentSchema

   If the instance is a string, and if "contentMediaType" is present,
   this property contains a schema which describes the structure of the
   string.

   This keyword MAY be used with any media type that can be mapped into
   JSON Schema's data model.

Internet-Draft           JSON Schema Validation              August 2019


   The value of this property SHOULD be ignored if "contentMediaType" is
   not present.

8.6.  Example

   Here is an example schema, illustrating the use of "contentEncoding"
   and "contentMediaType":


   {
       "type": "string",
       "contentEncoding": "base64",
       "contentMediaType": "image/png"
   }


   Instances described by this schema are expected to be strings, and
   their values should be interpretable as base64-encoded PNG images.

   Another example:


   {
       "type": "string",
       "contentMediaType": "text/html"
   }


   Instances described by this schema are expected to be strings
   containing HTML, using whatever character set the JSON string was
   decoded into.  Per section 8.1 of RFC 8259 [RFC8259], outside of an
   entirely closed system, this MUST be UTF-8.

   This example describes a JWT that is MACed using the HMAC SHA-256
   algorithm, and requires the "iss" and "exp" fields in its claim set.


   {
       "type": "string",
       "contentMediaType": "application/jwt",
       "contentSchema": {
           "type": "array",
           "minItems": 2,
           "items": [
               {
                   "const": {
                       "typ": "JWT",
                       "alg": "HS256"
                   }
               },
               {
                   "type": "object",
                   "required": ["iss", "exp"],
                   "properties": {
                       "iss": {"type": "string"},
                       "exp": {"type": "integer"}
                   }
               }
           ]
       }
   }

   Note that "contentEncoding" does not appear.  While the "application/
   jwt" media type makes use of base64url encoding, that is defined by
   the media type, which determines how the JWT string is decoded into a
   list of two JSON data structures: first the header, and then the
   payload.  Since the JWT media type ensures that the JWT can be
   represented in a JSON string, there is no need for further encoding
   or decoding.

9.  A Vocabulary for Basic Meta-Data Annotations

   These general-purpose annotation keywords provide commonly used
   information for documentation and user interface display purposes.
   They are not intended to form a comprehensive set of features.
   Rather, additional vocabularies can be defined for more complex
   annotation-based applications.

   Meta-schemas that do not use "$vocabulary" SHOULD be considered to
   require this vocabulary as if its URI were present with a value of
   true.

Internet-Draft           JSON Schema Validation              August 2019


   The current URI for this vocabulary, known as the Meta-Data
   vocabulary, is: <https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-WIP/vocab/meta-
   data>.

   The current URI for the corresponding meta-schema is: <https://json-
   schema.org/draft/2019-WIP/meta/meta-data>.

9.1.  "title" and "description"

   The value of both of these keywords MUST be a string.

   Both of these keywords can be used to decorate a user interface with
   information about the data produced by this user interface.  A title
   will preferably be short, whereas a description will provide
   explanation about the purpose of the instance described by this
   schema.

9.2.  "default"

   There are no restrictions placed on the value of this keyword.  When
   multiple occurrences of this keyword are applicable to a single sub-
   instance, implementations SHOULD remove duplicates.

   This keyword can be used to supply a default JSON value associated
   with a particular schema.  It is RECOMMENDED that a default value be
   valid against the associated schema.

9.3.  "deprecated"

   The value of this keyword MUST be a boolean.  When multiple
   occurrences of this keyword are applicable to a single sub-instance,
   the resulting value MUST be true if any occurrence specifies a true
   value, and MUST be false otherwise.

   If "deprecated" has a value of boolean true, it indicates that
   applications SHOULD refrain from usage of the declared property.  It
   MAY mean the property is going to be removed in the future.

   A root schema containing "deprecated" with a value of true indicates
   the entire root schema MAY be removed in the future.

   Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of false.

9.4.  "readOnly" and "writeOnly"

   The value of these keywords MUST be a boolean.  When multiple
   occurrences of these keywords are applicable to a single sub-




Wright, et al.          Expires February 11, 2020              [Page 21]

   instance, the resulting value MUST be true if any occurrence
   specifies a true value, and MUST be false otherwise.

   If "readOnly" has a value of boolean true, it indicates that the
   value of the instance is managed exclusively by the owning authority,
   and attempts by an application to modify the value of this property
   are expected to be ignored or rejected by that owning authority.

   An instance document that is marked as "readOnly for the entire
   document MAY be ignored if sent to the owning authority, or MAY
   result in an error, at the authority's discretion.

   If "writeOnly" has a value of boolean true, it indicates that the
   value is never present when the instance is retrieved from the owning
   authority.  It can be present when sent to the owning authority to
   update or create the document (or the resource it represents), but it
   will not be included in any updated or newly created version of the
   instance.

   An instance document that is marked as "writeOnly" for the entire
   document MAY be returned as a blank document of some sort, or MAY
   produce an error upon retrieval, or have the retrieval request
   ignored, at the authority's discretion.

   For example, "readOnly" would be used to mark a database-generated
   serial number as read-only, while "writeOnly" would be used to mark a
   password input field.

   These keywords can be used to assist in user interface instance
   generation.  In particular, an application MAY choose to use a widget
   that hides input values as they are typed for write-only fields.

   Omitting these keywords has the same behavior as values of false.

9.5.  "examples"

   The value of this keyword MUST be an array.  There are no
   restrictions placed on the values within the array.  When multiple
   occurrences of this keyword are applicable to a single sub-instance,
   implementations MUST provide a flat array of all values rather than
   an array of arrays.

   This keyword can be used to provide sample JSON values associated
   with a particular schema, for the purpose of illustrating usage.  It
   is RECOMMENDED that these values be valid against the associated
   schema.

   Implementations MAY use the value(s) of "default", if present, as an
   additional example.  If "examples" is absent, "default" MAY still be
   used in this manner.

10.  Security Considerations

   JSON Schema validation defines a vocabulary for JSON Schema core and
   concerns all the security considerations listed there.

   JSON Schema validation allows the use of Regular Expressions, which
   have numerous different (often incompatible) implementations.  Some
   implementations allow the embedding of arbitrary code, which is
   outside the scope of JSON Schema and MUST NOT be permitted.  Regular
   expressions can often also be crafted to be extremely expensive to
   compute (with so-called "catastrophic backtracking"), resulting in a
   denial-of-service attack.

   Implementations that support validating or otherwise evaluating
   instance string data based on "contentEncoding" and/or
   "contentMediaType" are at risk of evaluating data in an unsafe way
   based on misleading information.  Applications can mitigate this risk
   by only performing such processing when a relationship between the
   schema and instance is established (e.g., they share the same
   authority).

   Processing a media type or encoding is subject to the security
   considerations of that media type or encoding.  For example, the
   security considerations of RFC 4329 Scripting Media Types [RFC4329]
   apply when processing JavaScript or ECMAScript encoded within a JSON
   string.

Internet-Draft           JSON Schema Validation              August 2019


Appendix A.  Keywords Moved from Validation to Core

   Several keywords have been moved from this document into the Core
   Specification [json-schema] as of this draft, in some cases with re-
   naming or other changes.  This affects the following former
   validation keywords:

   "definitions"  Renamed to "$defs" to match "$ref" and be shorter to
      type.  Schema vocabulary authors SHOULD NOT define a "definitions"
      keyword with different behavior in order to avoid invalidating
      schemas that still use the older name.

   "allOf", "anyOf", "oneOf", "not", "if", "then", "else",
                                     "items", "additionalItems",
   "contains", "propertyNames",
   "properties", "patternProperties", "additionalProperties"
      All of these keywords apply subschemas to the instance and combine
      their results, without asserting any conditions of their own.
      Without assertion keywords, these applicators can only cause
      assertion failures by using the false boolean schema, or by
      inverting the result of the true boolean schema (or equivalent
      schema objects).  For this reason, they are better defined as a
      generic mechanism on which validation, hyper-schema, and extension
      vocabularies can all be based.

   "dependencies"  This keyword had two different modes of behavior,
      which made it relatively challenging to implement and reason
      about.  The schema form has been moved to Core and renamed to
      "dependentSchemas", as part of the applicator vocabulary.  It is
      analogous to "properties", except that instead of applying its
      subschema to the property value, it applies it to the object
      containing the property.  The property name array form is retained
      here and renamed to "dependentRequired", as it is an assertion
      which is a shortcut for the conditional use of the "required"
      assertion keyword.

      *  Specified all "content*" keywords as annotations, not
         assertions

      *  Added "contentSchema" to allow applying a schema to a string-
         encoded document

      *  Also allow RFC 4648 encodings in "contentEncoding"

         3339 format names

      *  I18N formats: "iri", "iri-reference", "idn-hostname", "idn-
         email"

      *  Clarify that "json-pointer" format means string encoding, not
